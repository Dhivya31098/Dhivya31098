                <h3><span class="purple-color">Design and Implementation of an IOT based Automated Agricultural Monitoring And Control System</span></h3>
                <p>Designed an automated agricultural monitoring system. Developed an software application to
                    control and monitor the water level, humidity and temperature of the soil without human
                    interaction.</p>

                    Network with Adam Optimization Algorithm</span></h3>
                <p>Detected and identified Diabetic Retinopathy with more accuracy and specificity. Segmented
                    and extracted the features of micro aneurysm using convolutional neural network algorithm
                    and optimised the accuracy and specificity using Adam optimizer. And have also published this
                    project paper in IEEE explore conducted by SSN college of engineering.</p>

                <h3><span class="purple-color">Detection of Exudates Using Atrous Algorithm with MobilenetV2 Architecture</span></h3>
                <p>The recent advancement of deep CNN in the identification of Exudates inspired us to identify
                    and classify exudates. In order to build an automated model to detect Exudates, we use Atrous
                    or dilated convolution in the most common deep neural network architectures.</p>
